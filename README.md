# About
It's a personal project to track progress in many courses I'm taking. Build for fun. The idea was born out of necessity (and way too many opened browser tabs).

# What it does
At the moment it does nothing.
But it will let you input the progress (in %) and save it, to have an overview of all the courses. No idea how to achieve it.
It's like Goodreads (books) or GG (games), but for learning (courses, tutorials, textbooks).

# What needs to be done
Basically everything, lol.
## urgent
Add the core functionality (how? `<form>` and `<input type="progress"`? Then what, connect it to a database of sorts to save it? Or store it in browser cache? No idea, I'll figure it out somehow.)
## later
Refactor the code to allow adding new courses from the UI. For this I guess I'll need a database... and probably user account so that the others won't mess with your stuff
